## Conclusion

Results show a clear upward trend in both heart rate and blood pressure with class level:

-   **Heart Rate**: Averages increase from 75 BPM (Beginner) to 85 BPM (Advanced).
-   **Blood Pressure**: Rises from 120 mmHg to 130 mmHg across the same groups.

This suggests that more advanced music training may be more physically or emotionally demanding. However, other factors such as stress, fitness, or individual variability could also influence these readings.

## Recommendation

1.Conduct longitudinal studies to track changes over time.

2.Include stress or emotion-related variables for a fuller picture.

3.Use physiological feedback to adapt teaching strategies.

4.Ensure breaks and support for advanced students to manage workload.
